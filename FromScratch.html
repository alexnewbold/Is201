    <h1 class="headers">Lacrosse Equipment Variations </h1>
    <br>Lacrosse sticks come in different variations depending on the position a player is on the field. Attack players typically use a shorter stick (30-42 inches) with a wider pocket to aid in catching and throwing. Midfielders use a similar length stick but with a slightly narrower pocket for both offense and defense. Defense players wield the longest sticks (52-72 inches) with a narrow pocket designed primarily for ground ball control and checking (striking an opponent's stick to dislodge the ball). Goalies have a uniquely designed stick with a large mesh pocket to block incoming shots.<br>

    More Cool Facts!
    <ul>
        <li class="changefont">There are several variations of lacrosse played today. Field lacrosse, the most common version, features ten players per side on a large field. Box lacrosse is a faster-paced indoor game played on a hockey rink with six players per team. Additionally, women's lacrosse differs from the men's game in terms of equipment and rules.  </li>
        <li class="makeitbold", class="changefont">Lacrosse is increasingly being incorporated into physical education programs due to its emphasis on teamwork, athleticism, and hand-eye coordination. Native American tribes are also using lacrosse as a tool to teach cultural traditions and values to younger generations.</li>
        <li class="changefont">Lacrosse comes in two forms, men's and women's, with key distinctions. Men's lacrosse allows for more physical contact and features deeper pockets in the sticks to carry the ball. Women's lacrosse emphasizes passing and agility due to shallower pockets and rules against body checking. Both require teamwork and athleticism, but differ in the equipment used, the number of players on the field, and the overall physicality of the game.</li>
